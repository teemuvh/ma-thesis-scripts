# Thesis scripts

This repository contains scripts I have used as a part of my thesis work.

To run, you need a sense embedding model trained with [AdaGram](https://github.com/sbos/AdaGram.jl).
The Julia model needs to be converted into a Python format. This can be done with [Python-AdaGram](https://github.com/lopuhin/python-adagram).

You need to define the model and the data you want to use into the script.
